# Dipping your toes

When learning something new a bit of hand-holding can go a long way. For example, when I get to a new city with an unfamiliar bus or train system, I will often avoid using that mode of transportation until I've gone on it at least once with a local, just to see how it works - do you pay on the train or before your board? Is change provided? Do you tap in *and* out or just in or just out? Typically all I need is one guided trip. 

If this resonates at all with you, here are two particularly good resources to show you the ropes:

  * **Swirl Stats** ([link](https://swirlstats.com/)) gets you started with R *within* R. The lessons are quick to get through and will help flatten the learning curve
  * **Markdown Tutorial** ([link](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)) does something similar to teach you Markdown. This isn't R per se, but within 10 minutes you'll learn the basics of Markdown syntax which can then be used together with R to create clean, reproducible documents. 
  
  

# Programming & Statistics

  * ***Discovering Statistics Using R*** ([link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HPZ4VVM/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_STnREbTZY2G0S)) by Andy Field, Jeremy Miles, and Zoe Field has been my go-to book since I started using R in 2014 and I continue to refer back to it to this day both for basic. One downside is that some of the packages are a bit outdated. 
  * ***R for Data Science*** ([link](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham is worth reading basically end-to-end for anyone using R for data analysis. This book goes through the basics of importing, cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data.
  
  
  
  
# Data Visualization

  * ***R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd Edition*** ([link](https://r-graphics.org/)) by Winston Chang
  * **ggplot2 reference** (<https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/>)


# File Management and Sharing

  * ***Happy Git and Github for the userR*** ([link](https://happygitwithr.com/))
